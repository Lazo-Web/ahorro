/**
 * This Firestore Security Ruleset is designed for a pantry and shopping management application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The security model implements a strict separation between public, shared data and private, user-owned data.
 * Public data is readable by anyone but managed centrally, while user data is accessible only by its owner.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /products/{productId}: A global collection of product details, readable by all users.
 * - /supermarkets/{supermarketId}: A global collection of supermarket details, readable by all users.
 * - /users/{userId}/...: A collection where each user's private data is stored in nested subcollections.
 *   - /pantry/{pantryItemId}: The user's personal pantry items.
 *   - /shoppingList/{shoppingListItemId}: The user's personal shopping list.
 *   - /purchases/{purchaseId}: The user's purchase history.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Data Isolation: All user-specific data (pantry, shopping list, purchases) is stored in subcollections under `/users/{userId}`. Access is granted exclusively based on the user's authenticated UID matching the `{userId}` in the path. This path-based ownership is simple, secure, and performant.
 * - No User Enumeration: Listing documents in the top-level `/users` collection is explicitly disallowed to protect user privacy and prevent enumeration attacks.
 * - Centrally Managed Public Data: The `/products` and `/supermarkets` collections are publicly readable but cannot be modified by clients. This assumes they are populated and managed by a trusted backend service or administrative process, which is a secure default for shared application data.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * This ruleset relies on Path-Based Ownership. For instance, securing `/users/{userId}/pantry/{itemId}` is achieved by simply comparing `request.auth.uid` to the `{userId}` wildcard from the path. This avoids costly and slow `get()` calls to other documents for authorization checks.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * The separation of public data (`/products`, `/supermarkets`) from private user data (`/users/{userId}/*`) is a core design choice. This structure ensures that queries for public data never risk exposing private information and that rules for private data can be simple and strict.
